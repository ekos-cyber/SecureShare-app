## Limited Contributions

Due to the sensitive security-focused nature of this application, direct code contributions (Pull Requests) are currently limited and strictly reviewed. We prioritize stability and security above all else.

## Reporting Issues and Suggestions

If you have suggestions, find bugs, or encounter issues, please do not open public issues or pull requests. Instead, please use **GitHub's Private Messaging** or **Private Vulnerability Reporting** features to contact the maintainers directly.

This approach helps us manage security risks and maintain the integrity of the zero-knowledge architecture.

## Security

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md) and report it privately.
